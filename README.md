# UIkit

## Overview

This site is based upon utilizing **UI kit Framework** to create an optional layout for one of my client's Photography Portfolio site.

## Advantages

1. I found the frame was pretty easy to integrate into an existing code. 
1. It is very modern and appealing to the eye as for client's experience.
1. Provides animation capabilites.
1. Code can be customized just by adding attributes, animation and other changes by adding to the class. 

## Disadvantages

1. Unlike other frameworks you need to create your own custom media queries for it to be more mobile friendly.
1. They offer Pro mode to make it easy to customize the site, but you must pay to utlize it. (I did the whole site based on the free resources for the framework. )
